      <h2>My Story</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      My name is Wahbi Hussain, a former refugee from Iraq. In 2003, having lived through the Iran War in the 1980s, then Desert Storm in the 90s, I had finally reached an age to step up and help liberate my country from the Saddam Hussein regime. I served as an interpreter and analyst with the U.S. Marines and Army, also contributing my services to other Coalition Forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working as an interpreter during the war came with considerable danger. Terrorist groups and militias targeted me as a traitor, an enemy, and a collaborator to the U.S. cause. I escaped a kidnapping, survived a series of shootings, and endured multiple extrajudicial detentions before seeking asylum in Jordan. There, after being held for a time against my will, local officials deported me back to Iraq, where I would be forced to live under constant threat to my life.

      Fortunately, my time as a deportee to Iraq was short-lived. The United Nations and the US government—and thanks in no small part to the involvement of a few key generals and other military officers, senators and congresspeople, and even the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State to the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration—stepped in to rescue me from the tragic fate that surely awaited me in my home country. Their outstanding efforts and incredible support saved my life. Thanks to their intervention, I was relocated from Iraq to the U.S. in October 2008.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon arrival to the United States, I wanted to continue my support to the United States government, but this dream required security clearances, and security clearances required a U.S. citizenship. According to the law, I had to live in the U.S. for five years before I could apply for citizenship.
    </p>

    <p>
      I decided to continue my education, but coursework at a university was not something I could afford. Instead, I took advantage of the free education courses available on the internet. Meanwhile, I worked as a dishwasher, then later a cook, and later still, a waiter in a restaurant. When the opportunity arose to serve the refugee community as a case manager with the Catholic Charities Refugee Department, this became the main focus of my career. To earn extra income, I contributed as a construction and remodeling worker in the evenings before studying for my online courses into the night.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a time, I considered starting my own construction and remodeling company, but instead, I decided to follow my true passion and invest my time in the field of technology. Today, I am an experienced Software Engineer specializing in Data Engineering. I am mainly self-taught, and thanks to the American Dream, I am now a U.S. citizen living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I am proud to have served this great country during my time in Iraq, and I intend to use every resource at my disposal to continue serving the great people living on U.S. soil.

      My experiences and very long journey to U.S. citizenship have taught me how short life can be. The struggles I endured inspired me to rethink my purpose. They have taught me that we can manipulate our brains and change our perspective; we can train ourselves to appreciate what we have; and with the right tools and outlook, we can generate energy to achieve our goals and reach success (which I define as achieving happiness). My purpose is to educate the current generation for a better future—not just through the reimagining of our mindsets, but also through working and contributing together rather than simply following the lead of others.​
    </p>
    <p>
      On behalf of those who stood up to do the right thing but never made it to tell their story, I am standing up again. I am taking another risk by sharing this powerful true story. My hope is that it will inspire people, and possibly save lives. Through small contributions and acts of kindness, we can all change the world. I hope that my story will help people discover and unleash their already existing hidden potential, just like I discovered and unleashed mine!
